# AvoFeedBack

_A handcrafted, open-source feedback board for WordPress, inspired by LogChimp.  
Created by Joseph Brzezowski, for the community—deaf-owned, honest, and proudly different._

## Why AvoFeedBack?

Every business, every community, and every creator deserves a place where people can **speak up, be heard, and see real change**. Too many feedback tools are cold, complicated, or just out of reach for small teams.  
**AvoFeedBack** changes that—it’s yours, on your WordPress, and feels as human as a handshake.

## What’s Special?

- **Easy to use** – simple for your users, powerful for your team
- **Open-source** – own your board, forever
- **Inclusive** – accessible by design, built by and for real people, especially the Deaf community
- **Zero fluff** – no spammy marketing, no forced signups, no junk
