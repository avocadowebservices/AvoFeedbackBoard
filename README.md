# AvoFeedBack

AvoFeedBack is an open-source feedback board for WordPress, handcrafted by Joseph Brzezowskiâ€”deaf-owned, community-driven, and inspired by LogChimp. This project aims to help small businesses, creators, and anyone who wants real feedback in a way that feels human, honest, and open.

## Why AvoFeedBack?

Because every voice matters. Too many tools feel cold or are too expensive. This one is for us.
